Task

The app component is passed a sentence as props. Take this sentence and then pass it to an internal method that
returns a an object with `key` = word and `value` = times that word has occurred. Then pass this object as a prop to
another component (that you will just create), route the app to this component to display the results.
No special UI is needed in this second screen, just be creative. Thanks
